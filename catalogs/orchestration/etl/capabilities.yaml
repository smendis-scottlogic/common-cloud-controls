capabilities:
  - id: CCC.ETL.CP01
    title: Batch Processing
    description: |
      Supports the processing of bounded (batch) data sources
      using a consistent programming model or engine.
  
  - id: CCC.ETL.CP02
    title: Stream Processing
    description: |
      Supports the processing of unbounded (streaming) data sources
      using a consistent programming model or engine.

  - id: CCC.ETL.CP03
    title: Schema Evolution
    description: |
      Automatically detects source data structures and manages changes in
      schema (e.g., column additions) over time without pipeline failure.

  - id: CCC.ETL.CP04
    title: Distributed Data Shuffling
    description: |
      Provides an internal service to re-partition and group data across
      distributed workers for complex operations like joins and aggregations.

  - id: CCC.ETL.CP05
    title: Windowing and Event-Time Processing
    description: |
      Enables grouping of data based on time attributes, supporting tumbling,
      hopping, and session windows with late-data handling (watermarking).

  - id: CCC.ETL.CP06
    title: Change Data Capture (CDC) Integration
    description: |
      Supports incremental data ingestion by tracking changes in source
      transaction logs rather than full table scans.

  - id: CCC.ETL.CP07
    title: Connectivity and Connector Library
    description: |
      Provides pre-built, managed connectors for a variety of sources and
      sinks (e.g., Object Storage, RDBMS, NoSQL, Pub/Sub).

  - id: CCC.ETL.CP08
    title: Job Bookmarks
    description: |
      Persists the state of a processing job (e.g., checkpointing or bookmarks)
      to ensure exactly-once processing and fault tolerance.

  - id: CCC.ETL.CP09
    title: Pushdown Optimization
    description: |
      The ability to translate transformation logic into the native language
      of the source or sink (e.g., SQL) to minimize data movement.

  - id: CCC.ETL.CP10
    title: Visual Orchestration
    description: |
      Provides a graphical interface to define dependencies
      between extraction, transformation, and loading tasks.

  - id: CCC.ETL.CP11
    title: Data Lineage & Metadata Tracking
    description: |
      Captures and exports metadata regarding the data sources,
      the transformation steps, and the final destination (sink), showing the
      flow from source to destination for compliance and debugging.

  - id: CCC.ETL.CP12
    title: User-Defined Function (UDF) Support
    description: |
      Allows developers to inject custom logic (Python, Java, SQL) into the
      managed processing pipeline for complex transformations.

  - id: CCC.ETL.CP13
    title: Time-Based Job Triggering
    description: |
      Supports time-based (cron) mechanisms to initiate data processing workflows.

  - id: CCC.ETL.CP14
    title: Event Based Job Triggering
    description: |
      Supports event-based (file arrival) mechanisms to initiate
      data processing workflows.
